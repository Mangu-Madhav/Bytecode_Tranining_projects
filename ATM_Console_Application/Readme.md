# **🏧 ATM Console Application**

**📌 Project Overview**

- This ATM Console Application is a simple Python-based program that simulates the core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to securely log in using a PIN and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing cash, depositing cash, and changing the PIN.

- This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand Python control structures, loops, conditionals, match-case, and basic input handling.

**🚀 Features**
---
✔️**Secure Login System**

- User must enter the correct 4-digit PIN.

- Maximum 3 attempts allowed.

- After 3 failed attempts, the card gets blocked.

✔️ **Main Menu Options**

- Check Balance – Displays current account balance.

- Withdraw Cash – Allows withdrawals in multiples of 100 only.
